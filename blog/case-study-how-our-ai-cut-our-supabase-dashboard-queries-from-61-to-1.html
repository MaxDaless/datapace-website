                <p>Sometimes, the most dangerous performance problems aren't the ones you can see.</p>

                <p>It wasn't a crash or a major outage. It was a slow, creeping decline in our user dashboard's performance. At Datapace, we're not just building a performance tool; we're using it every day to optimize our own applications. And recently, our own AI had to save us from ourselves.</p>

                <p>We knew the problem was the database, but our manual checks were mystifying. <code>EXPLAIN ANALYZE</code> on individual queries showed they were all reasonably fast. There was no single "slow query" to blame. This is the story of how our AI diagnosed a severe N+1 query storm and, with a single recommendation, cut the dashboard's query load by over 98%.</p>

                <blockquote>
                    <p><strong>TL;DR:</strong></p>
                    <ol>
                        <li><strong>The Problem:</strong> Our user dashboard was making <strong>61 separate database queries</strong> to load a list of 20 projects, causing severe performance issues that were invisible to standard query analysis.</li>
                        <li><strong>The Diagnosis:</strong> The Datapace AI analyzed the application's query traffic and automatically identified the N+1 anti-pattern, pinpointing the cascade of redundant queries.</li>
                        <li><strong>The Fix:</strong> We implemented the AI's recommended SQL function, which used <code>JOINs</code> and a <code>LATERAL</code> subquery to gather all required data in a <strong>single query</strong>.</li>
                        <li><strong>The Result:</strong> Page load time dropped from <strong>2.8 seconds to 150 milliseconds</strong>, and database CPU usage fell by 40%.</li>
                    </ol>
                </blockquote>

                <h2>The "Before": A Death by 61 Database Trips</h2>

                <p>The dashboard was designed to show a list of projects with their name, the most recent task, the project owner, and a count of active members.</p>

                <p>Frustrated by manual checks, we let the Datapace AI analyze the application's query traffic. It surfaced the root cause in under an hour:</p>

                <p>Here's what was happening every time a user loaded their dashboard with 20 projects:</p>

                <h4>The "1" Query:</h4>

                <p>A single query to fetch the user's 20 projects.</p>

                <pre><code class="language-javascript">const { data: projects } = await supabase
  .from('projects')
  .select('*')
  .eq('user_id', userId);</code></pre>

                <h4>The "N" Queries:</h4>

                <p>Then, for <strong>each</strong> of those 20 projects, our code made <strong>three more queries</strong> inside a loop:</p>

                <ol>
                    <li>One query to get the latest task.</li>
                    <li>One query to get the project owner's name.</li>
                    <li>One query to count the active members.</li>
                </ol>

                <p>The math was brutal: <strong>1 + (20 Projects √ó 3 Queries/Project) = 61 Queries.</strong></p>

                <p>Our app was slow because it was making 61 separate round trips to the database to render a single page. This cascade was invisible to basic monitoring but was the undeniable source of our performance issues.</p>

                <hr>

                <h2>The "After": The AI's Recommendation</h2>

                <p>The Datapace AI didn't just identify the problem; it provided the solution. It generated an optimized SQL query for a Supabase RPC function that could gather all the data in one efficient trip.</p>

                <p>The recommendation used <code>JOINs</code> to fetch the owner's name and a <code>LATERAL</code> subquery‚Äîa powerful Postgres feature perfect for "get the top-N-per-group" problems like finding the most recent task for each project.</p>

                <h4>The AI-Recommended SQL:</h4>

                <pre><code class="language-sql">-- This function gets all required data in one query
SELECT
  p.id,
  p.name,
  u.full_name as owner_name,
  tasks.task_name as latest_task,
  (SELECT COUNT(m.id) FROM members m WHERE m.project_id = p.id) as active_members
FROM
  projects p
JOIN
  users u ON p.owner_id = u.id
LEFT JOIN LATERAL (
  SELECT t.name as task_name
  FROM tasks t
  WHERE t.project_id = p.id
  ORDER BY t.created_at DESC
  LIMIT 1
) tasks ON true
WHERE
  p.user_id = 'some-user-id';</code></pre>

                <p>Our team implemented this in a Supabase function and replaced the 61 queries with a single RPC call.</p>

                <pre><code class="language-javascript">// One query to rule them all
const { data: dashboardData } = await supabase
  .rpc('get_dashboard_projects');</code></pre>

                <hr>

                <h2>The Results: A 60x Improvement üöÄ</h2>

                <p>The impact was immediate and dramatic.</p>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Query Count:</strong> Dropped from <strong>61 to 1</strong> per dashboard load.</li>
                    <li><strong>Page Load Time:</strong> Decreased from <strong>2.8 seconds to 150 milliseconds</strong>.</li>
                    <li><strong>Database CPU:</strong> Average utilization during peak hours was <strong>reduced by 40%</strong>, allowing us to downgrade our instance for significant cost savings.</li>
                </ul>

                <hr>

                <h2>Conclusion: Seeing the Forest for the Trees</h2>

                <p>The most dangerous performance issues aren't always in a single slow query; they often hide in the patterns <em>between</em> your application code and your database. A human developer using <code>EXPLAIN ANALYZE</code> on any of the 61 individual queries would have seen a "fast" result, completely missing the larger storm of inefficiency.</p>

                <p>This is where AI-driven observability shines. It can analyze thousands of queries in context, identify wasteful application-level patterns like the N+1 problem, and provide a holistic, actionable solution. By automating this deep analysis, we were able to find and fix a problem that was slowing down our app, frustrating our users, and quietly draining our resources.</p>
